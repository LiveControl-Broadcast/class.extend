This is a fork of https://github.com/allenhwkim/class.extend.  The only reason it exists is because the original author of the `class.extend` package never published his latest commits to NPM.

No changes have been made to this repository except to edit this `README.md` file and to increment the `package.json` version to `0.9.3-lc` to make it obvious that we are installing the correct version.
